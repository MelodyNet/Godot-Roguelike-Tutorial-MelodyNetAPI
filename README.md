# Godot-Roguelike-Tutorial-MelodyNetAPI
This is a fork of [MateuSai's Godot-Roguelike-Tutorial](https://github.com/MateuSai/Godot-Roguelike-Tutorial) to demonstrate how to use MelodyNet API to add music to your games

## Instructions
1. Go to the [MelodyNet Website](https://melodynet-web.vercel.app) to register your account

2. After you're logged in, connect your Spotify (Premium account required)

- CURRENTLY OUR APP IS IN DEVELOPMENT MODE SO YOU WILL NEED TO CONTACT US DIRECTLY TO AUTHORIZE YOUR SPOTIFY ACCOUNT WITH OUR API

3. Create your API key and copy it to your clipboard. 

2. Clone this repository and past your API key in Rooms.gd where it says `var api_key = "enter your API key here"`

3. Open Spotify (desktop/mobile app or web player) and start playing any random song.

4. Start playing the game. The API should be called everytime a new floor starts, playing a new song on your Spotify. Normal floors will play a happy song, while boss floors will play motivational songs.
